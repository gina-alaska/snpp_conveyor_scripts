snpp_conveyor_scripts
=====================

Conveyor scripts for processing SNPP data

Usage
-----

Check these scripts out to /home/processing/conveyor   

Each sub-directory contains conveyor configuration that should be run in its own screen process.
This is due to conveyor being unable to have multiple workers watching the same directory.
